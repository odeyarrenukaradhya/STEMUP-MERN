# üåü AstroShop ‚Äì Reports & Readings

## üß≠ Project Overview
AstroShop is a front-end eCommerce website designed to showcase and sell astrology-related products such as horoscope reports, compatibility readings, and career guidance PDFs.  
The project simulates a real shopping experience with product listings, order forms, and a functioning cart system ‚Äî all built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Users can view products, add them to the cart (with a cart limit), and fill out a purchase request form.  
It also includes interactive UI elements like hover effects, alerts to make the user experience more engaging.
